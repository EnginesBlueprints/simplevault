All secret information is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms. SimpleVault is particularly useful if you need to manage your secret data, or if you want to share secret information within a working group with trusted members. But it can also be used as a common tool for users who don't trust each other.","icon_url":"http://simplevault.sourceforge.net/logo.png","home_page_url":"http://simplevault.sourceforge.net/","support_page_url":"","about":"","language":"php","framework":"apache_php","deployment_type":"web","publisher":"engines","blocking_worker_name":null,"required_memory":90,"recommended_memory":128,"http_protocol":"https_only","framework_port_overide":null,"custom_start_script":"","custom_install_script":"","custom_post_install_script":"","service_configurations":[{"publisher_namespace":"EnginesSystem","type_path":"filesystem/local/filesystem","variables":{"engine_path":"private","volume_src":" ","permissions":"rw","name":"_Engines_Builder(engine_name)"}}],"persistent_directories":[],"replacement_strings":[],"persistent_files":[],"installed_packages":[{"name":"simplevault-1.9.tgz","source_url":"http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/simplevault/simplevault/simplevault-1.9.tgz","destination":"./","extraction_command":"tar -xpfz","path_to_extracted":"simplevault-1.9"}],"system_packages":[],"workers":[],"rake_tasks":[],"template_files":[{"title":"configuration file","path":"app/svconfig.php","content":"\u003c?php\r\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n// *** Simplevault Settings\r\n// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n// date format string as used by php function 'date'\r\n//$dateformat = 'm.d.y G:i';    // \"09.19.07 15:44\"\r\n//$dateformat = 'M jS Y g:ia';  // \"Sep 19th 2007 3:44pm\"\r\n//$dateformat = 'd-M-Y G:i';    // \"09-Sep-2007 15:44\"\r\n$dateformat = 'd-M-Y';          // \"09-Sep-2007\"\r\ndate_default_timezone_set('_Engines_System(timezone_country_city)');\r\n\r\n\r\n// Checks if the pass phrase that was entered to encode an entry has already\r\n// been used to encode other entries.
